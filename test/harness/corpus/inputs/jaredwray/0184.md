# Features
* No configuration required. Just setup the folder structure with a logo, favicon, and css file.
* Builds a static website that can be hosted anywhere.
* Simple search is provided by default out of the box.
* Support for single page with readme or multiple markdown pages in a docs folder.
* Full TypeScript support with typed configuration and IDE autocompletion.
* For more complex projects easily add a `docula.config.ts` (TypeScript) or `docula.config.mjs` (JavaScript) file to customize the build process with lifecycle hooks and `DoculaConsole` logging.
* Will generate a sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and `feed.xml` for your site.
* Automatically generates `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` for LLM-friendly indexing of docs, API reference, and changelog content.
* OpenAPI / Swagger support for auto-generating an interactive API reference page.
* Uses Github release notes and file-based changelog entries to generate a changelog with individual pages, pagination, and preview text.
* Uses Github to show contributors and link to their profiles.
* Light, dark, and system theme modes with a built-in toggle.
* Easy styling customization via `variables.css` with no template editing required.
* Watch mode with auto-rebuild for local development.

# Standalone Binary

You can build Docula as a standalone binary that runs without Node.js installed. This uses [Node.js Single Executable Applications (SEA)](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html) to embed the runtime and all dependencies into a single executable.

## Building the Binary

Requires Node.js >= 25.7.0 to build (the resulting binary does not need Node.js to run). The build uses [tsdown's `exe` option](https://tsdown.dev/options/exe), which wraps Node.js's [Single Executable Applications](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html) feature added in Node 25.7.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:binary
```

This produces a platform-specific binary at `dist/docula` (or `dist/docula.exe` on Windows).

## What the Build Does

1. Embeds all built-in templates (modern, classic) into the bundle as base64
2. Bundles all source code and dependencies into a single CJS file via [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev/)
3. Uses tsdown's built-in `exe` option to create a Node.js SEA binary — blob generation, injection, and (on macOS hosts) ad-hoc code signing are handled automatically

## Testing the Binary

After building, test it locally:

```bash
# Show help
./dist/docula help

# Show version
./dist/docula version

# Initialize a new project
./dist/docula init -s ./my-site

# Build a site
./dist/docula build -s ./my-site -o ./my-site/dist
```

## Cross-Platform Binaries

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/build-binaries.yaml`) builds each platform natively on its own runner. Native builds avoid the cross-compile signing pitfall on Apple Silicon, where unsigned Mach-O binaries are killed on launch.

| Platform | Runner | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Linux x64 | `ubuntu-latest` | `docula-linux-x64` |
| macOS ARM64 | `macos-latest` | `docula-macos-arm64` |
| Windows x64 | `windows-latest` | `docula-windows-x64` |

Binaries are uploaded as build artifacts on every run and attached to GitHub releases automatically.

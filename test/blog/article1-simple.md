## Docula: Persistent Links and Styles!

In our last update, we simplified the modules down to two (<u>[docula-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docula-ui)</u>, and <u>[docula-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docula-core))</u> and also added In-Memory data stores as the default. Now with this latest update, we made it so that you can do <u>[persistent linking](https://docu.la/docs/article/configuration/deeplinks)</u> and <u>[customize the interface](https://docu.la/docs/article/configuration/customization)</u> it very easily.

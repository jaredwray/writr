/// Represents the result of consuming an argument from the token stream during
/// LaTeX macro expansion.
///
/// In KaTeX, macros can take arguments enclosed in braces `{}` or delimited by
/// specific tokens. This struct captures the tokens that form the argument,
/// along with the boundary tokens that define its start and end in the input
/// stream. Arguments are essential for parameterized macro expansion, allowing
/// macros to operate on variable content.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// When parsing a macro like `\frac{a}{b}`, each braced group becomes a
/// `MacroArg`:
/// - The first argument contains tokens for 'a', with start/end tokens being
///   `{` and `}`.
/// - The second argument contains tokens for 'b', similarly bounded.
///
/// This structure enables precise tracking of argument boundaries for error
/// reporting and nested macro processing.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `tokens`: The sequence of tokens that constitute the argument's content.
///   These tokens are extracted from the input stream and may include nested
///   structures, subscripts, or other LaTeX constructs.
/// - `start`: The token that marks the beginning of the argument. Typically an
///   opening delimiter like `{` or a specific command token that initiates
///   argument consumption.
/// - `end`: The token that marks the end of the argument. Usually a closing
///   delimiter like `}` or a matching token that terminates argument parsing.
///
/// # Error Handling
///
/// Argument consumption may fail if delimiters are mismatched or if the stream
/// ends unexpectedly. See [`MacroContextInterface::consume_arg`] for related
/// error conditions.
///
/// # Cross-references
///
/// - Used by [`MacroContextInterface::consume_arg`] to return parsed arguments.
/// - Related to token processing in [`crate::lexer`] and macro expansion in
///   [`crate::parser`].

/// efficient stack-based processing during parsing.
///
/// Macro expansion is a core mechanism in LaTeX for defining reusable
/// constructs, such as mathematical symbols, formatting commands, or complex
/// expressions. For example, `\alpha` expands to the Greek letter α, while
/// parameterized macros like `\frac{numerator}{denominator}` expand based on
/// provided arguments.
///
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `tokens`: The sequence of tokens resulting from macro expansion. These
///   tokens replace the original macro call in the input stream and are stored
///   in reverse order for efficient processing by the parser.
/// - `num_args`: The number of arguments this macro expects. For example,
///   `\frac` expects 2 arguments, while `\alpha` expects 0.
/// - `delimiters`: Optional delimiters for each argument. Each inner vector
///   specifies the opening and closing delimiters for an argument. If `None`,
///   arguments are typically braced.
/// - `unexpandable`: Whether this macro should not be further expanded. Used in
///   TeX's `\let` command to create aliases that preserve the original
///   behavior.
///
/// # Error Handling
///
/// Expansion may fail if arguments don't match the expected delimiters or if
/// the macro is undefined. See [`MacroContextInterface::expand_macro`] for
/// expansion error conditions.
